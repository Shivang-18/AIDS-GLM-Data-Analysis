# AIDS-GLM-Data-Analysis

This project involves an in-depth analysis of clinical trial data to investigate the effects of two antiretroviral drugs (ddC and ddI) on HIV/AIDS patients who have failed or are intolerant to zidovudine (AZT) therapy. The dataset comprises longitudinal and survival data collected from 1405 observations across 12 variables.

Objectives:

-> Examine the time-varying effects of antiretroviral drugs on disease progression and survival.
-> Analyze the relationship between CD4 cell count changes and predictors such as drug type, gender, prior AIDS diagnosis, and AZT use.
-> Assess the survival rates based on demographic and clinical factors.

Methodology:
-> Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) were used for modeling repeated measures data, with correlation structures tailored to the data.
-> Survival analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of various factors on patient outcomes.
-> Statistical significance and clinical relevance were considered in all analyses.

Key Findings:
-> Time significantly influences CD4 cell count changes, with gradual improvements observed across time points.
-> Previous AIDS diagnoses significantly increased the risk of adverse outcomes.
-> Drug type (ddC vs. ddI) had no statistically significant impact on survival, while gender showed borderline significance favoring male patients.
-> Time and interaction effects between drugs and time were significant for some analyses, indicating dynamic drug effects.


Outcomes:
-> The findings provide insights into the clinical management of HIV patients, highlighting the importance of early intervention and tailored treatment plans.
-> This research emphasizes the need for considering gender, prior medical history, and time-varying effects in drug efficacy studies.
